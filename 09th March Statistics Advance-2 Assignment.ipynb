    "\"\"\"Q1: What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain with\n",
    "an example.\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans:  Probability Mass Function (PMF) is a function that gives the probability of a discrete random variable taking on a \n",
    "particular value. For example, if we have a coin toss experiment, the PMF would tell us the probability of getting heads or \n",
    "tails. \n",
    "\n",
    "Probability Density Function (PDF) is a function that gives the probability of a continuous random variable taking on a \n",
    "particular value. For example, if we have a normal distribution, the PDF would tell us the probability of getting any value\n",
    "within the range of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both PMF and PDF are used to describe the probability of a random variable taking on a particular value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q2: What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why CDF is used?\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: Cumulative Density Function (CDF) is a function that gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to \n",
    "a certain value. It is used to describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a continuous random variable X with a probability density function (PDF) f(x), then the CDF of X is \n",
    "defined as F(x) = P(X ≤ x).\n",
    "\n",
    "CDF is used to determine the probability that a random variable will take on a value less than or equal to a given value. It \n",
    "is also used to compare the probability distributions of two or more random variables. Additionally, it can be used to \n",
    "calculate the expected value of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q3: What are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model?\n",
    "Explain how the parameters of the normal distribution relate to the shape of the distribution.\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: Examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model include: \n",
    "1. Measuring the heights of people in a population. \n",
    "2. Measuring the IQ scores of students in a school. \n",
    "3. Measuring the amount of rainfall in a region over a period of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters of the normal distribution relate to the shape of the distribution in that they determine the mean, variance, \n",
    "and standard deviation of the data. The mean is the center of the distribution and determines where most of the data points \n",
    "will be located. The variance is the spread of the data and determines how wide or narrow the distribution will be. The \n",
    "standard deviation is a measure of how much variation there is in the data and determines how much of the data falls within \n",
    "certain ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters of the normal distribution also determine the shape of the distribution. The mean and variance determine the \n",
    "peak of the distribution, while the standard deviation determines how much of the data falls within certain ranges. The shape \n",
    "of a normal distribution is symmetrical, with most of the data points located around the mean and the rest of the data points \n",
    "spread out evenly on either side.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q4: Explain the importance of Normal Distribution. Give a few real-life examples of Normal Distribution.\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: Normal Distribution is a type of probability distribution that is symmetrical around the mean, showing that data near the \n",
    "mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean. It is also known as the Gaussian Distribution or Bell Curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal Distribution is important because it can be used to model and predict the probability of certain outcomes. It is also \n",
    "used to measure the variability of data and to determine the probability of an event occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-life examples of Normal Distribution include: \n",
    "1. Heights of people in a population \n",
    "2. Test scores on a standardized test \n",
    "3. Blood pressure readings \n",
    "4. IQ scores \n",
    "5. Weight of items in a manufacturing process \n",
    "6. Measurement errors in a scientific experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q5: What is Bernaulli Distribution? Give an Example. What is the difference between Bernoulli Distribution and Binomial \n",
    "Distribution?\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans:  Bernoulli Distribution is a type of probability distribution that has two possible outcomes, usually labeled as \"success\"\n",
    "and \"failure\". It is a special case of the binomial distribution where n = 1. An example of a Bernoulli Distribution would be \n",
    "flipping a coin, where the probability of getting heads is 0.5 and the probability of getting tails is also 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between Bernoulli Distribution and Binomial Distribution is that Bernoulli Distribution only has two possible \n",
    "outcomes, while Binomial Distribution has more than two possible outcomes. Additionally, Bernoulli Distribution is a special case\n",
    "of Binomial Distribution where n = 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Bernoulli Distribution is a type of probability distribution with two possible outcomes, while Binomial Distribution\n",
    "is a type of probability distribution with more than two possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q6. Consider a dataset with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. If we assume that the dataset is normally \n",
    "distributed, what is the probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater than 60? Use the appropriate formula \n",
    "and show your calculations.\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: P(X > 60) = 1 - P(X ≤ 60)\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X ≤ 60) = (60 - 50)/10 = 0.67\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, P(X > 60) = 1 - 0.67 = 0.33\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater than 60 is 0.33.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q7: Explain uniform Distribution with an example.\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: Uniform distribution is a type of probability distribution in which all outcomes are equally likely. An example of a \n",
    "uniform distribution is the roll of a fair die. Each side of the die has an equal chance of being rolled, so each outcome \n",
    "(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) has an equal probability of 1/6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of a uniform distribution is the toss of a fair coin. Each side of the coin has an equal chance of being \n",
    "tossed, so each outcome (heads or tails) has an equal probability of 1/2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q8: What is the z score? State the importance of the z score.\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: The z score is a measure of how many standard deviations a given data point is from the mean of a data set. It is important \n",
    "because it allows us to compare different data points to each other and to the mean, and it can be used to calculate probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a data point has a z score of 1.5, it is 1.5 standard deviations away from the mean. This can be used to \n",
    "calculate the probability that a data point will fall within a certain range of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q9: What is Central Limit Theorem? State the significance of the Central Limit Theorem.\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: The Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample means approaches a normal distribution as \n",
    "the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. This theorem is significant because it \n",
    "allows us to make inferences about a population based on a sample, even if we don't know the exact shape of the population \n",
    "distribution. It also allows us to use the normal distribution to approximate other distributions, such as the binomial and \n",
    "Poisson distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Central Limit Theorem is also important because it allows us to use the normal distribution to calculate probabilities and \n",
    "confidence intervals for sample means. This is especially useful in hypothesis testing, where we can use the normal distribution\n",
    "to calculate the probability of obtaining a sample mean that is significantly different from the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q10: State the assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem.\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "1. The sample size is large enough (n > 30).\n",
    "2. The population from which the sample is drawn is normally distributed or the sample size is large enough that the Central Limit Theorem applies regardless of the population distribution.\n",
    "3. The samples are independent of each other.\n",
    "4. The sample means are independent of each other."
